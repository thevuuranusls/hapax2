> An implementation of a [Google Ctemplate](http://code.google.com/p/google-ctemplate) style language in Java.  The Hapax language differs from Ctemplate in some minor ways, not having had any backward compatibility issues and not having the same kind of runtime.  It is simpler.  See [Language](Language.md) and [Example](Example.md).

> Hapax2 is a rewrite and update from [Hapax](http://code.google.com/p/hapax).

> # Hapax 3 #

> Two Hapax3's are recommended replacements for Hapax2.  Hapax3 is a downstream rewrite for features and reliability.
